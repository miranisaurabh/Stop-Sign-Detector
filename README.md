File Details:

data_labelling.py --> This script shows the image and asks the user to plot a region of interest. Multiple roi's can be given. It used the roipoly library. It generates an output numpy array of binary values 1 and 0, where 1 represents roi and 0 otherwise

generate_data.py --> This script loads all the training images and their respective labels y=0 or 1 as numpy arrays and vectorizes them for faster computations, i.e. converts BGR (mxnx3) image to (m*nx3) 2D array where each row is a pixel and columns represent B,G and R channels respectively. It saves 2 npy files, X containing data of training images and Y containing data of image labels

training_gaussian.py --> This script takes the numpy arrays X and Y generated by generate_data.py file as input. It uses MLE method to compute all the parameters required for the model, theta,mu and sigma for both the classes and stores them in a text file.

stop_sign_detector --> The code is well commented and explains almost everything.
